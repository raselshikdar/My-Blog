Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects). 

Currently I am focusing on front-end technologies that help people design complex applications to be simpler to use, enabling functionality while optimizing the user experience.

I love to chase ideas and I spend a lot of time using some great product applications, learning from their successes and using them to inspire my creativity.
